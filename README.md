---

**[NEW]** A dockerized version with a new feature of storing chat history is available [here](https://github.com/nguynking/hpc). Special thanks to [@nguynking](https://github.com/nguynking).

Code for our Big Data and its Applications project at UEH. We fine-tune XLM-RoBERTa model on SQuADv2 dataset for Extractive Question Answering task and compare its performance to other models. We deploy the model to a [website](https://ueh-bigdata.github.io/) using Gradio.
